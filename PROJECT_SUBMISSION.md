   - Natural language query parsing ("fintech in NYC", "series B with 18 employees")
   - Exact numeric filtering for employee count and founding year
   - Autocomplete suggestions and search history
   - Smart filtering that integrates with Select All

2. **Bulk Operations**
   - Multi-select with Shift+Click for range selection
   - Ctrl/Cmd+Click for individual additions
   - Context-aware bulk actions (Like, Ignore, Clear Statuses, Delete)
   - Conflict resolution for duplicate detection

3. **Enhanced UI/UX**
   - Google Docs-inspired clean interface
   - Sticky columns for important fields
   - Horizontal scrolling for data-rich tables
   - Column visibility controls
   - Persistent sorting preferences
   - Visual filter indicators

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Virtual scrolling with MUI DataGrid
   - Debounced search input
   - Efficient batch operations
   - Pagination with customizable page sizes

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Approach

### Backend Architecture

1. **Database Layer**
   - SQLAlchemy ORM with relationship mapping
   - Bulk operation support with `bulk_insert_mappings`
   - Transaction management for data consistency
   - Intentional throttle preserved (100ms per insert)

2. **API Design**
   - RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
   - Bulk endpoints: `/bulk-add`, `/bulk-remove`
   - Conflict checking: `/check-conflicts`, `/check-statuses`
   - Search endpoints: `/search`, `/search/ids`, `/search/suggest`
   - WebSocket for real-time progress updates

3. **Search Infrastructure**
   - Self-hosted Elasticsearch integration
   - Custom natural language parser
   - Index mappings for company data
   - Aggregations for faceted search

### Frontend Architecture

1. **State Management**
   - React Context API for global selection state
   - Local state for component-specific data
   - localStorage for user preferences

2. **Component Design**
   - `EnhancedCompanyTable`: Main data grid with selection logic
   - `SmartSearchBar`: Google-style search with NLP
   - `BulkActionBar`: Context-aware bulk operations
   - `ProgressModal`: WebSocket-connected progress display
   - `ConflictResolutionDialog`: Duplicate handling UI

3. **User Experience**
   - Optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback
   - Clear visual states (hover, selected, loading)
   - Keyboard shortcuts for power users
   - Responsive error handling

## ü§î Key Assumptions & Decisions

### Assumptions

1. **Scale**: Users regularly work with 10,000+ companies
2. **Performance**: Database throttle is intentional and must be worked around
3. **User Behavior**: Mix of casual clicking and power-user bulk operations
4. **Data Integrity**: Duplicates should be prevented/handled gracefully

### Design Decisions

1. **WebSockets over Polling**
   - Chose WebSockets for real-time updates to minimize server load
   - More responsive progress tracking than polling

2. **Elasticsearch for Search**
   - Selected for powerful text search and aggregations
   - Enables natural language queries out of the box
   - Scales well with large datasets

3. **Optimistic UI Updates**
   - Update UI immediately, then sync with backend
   - Provides instant feedback despite slow database

4. **Context API over Redux**
   - Simpler state management for this scope
   - Easier to understand and maintain
   - Sufficient for current requirements

### Trade-offs

1. **Complexity vs Features**
   - Added Elasticsearch increases deployment complexity
   - Benefit: Significantly better search experience

2. **Memory vs Performance**
   - Loading all selected IDs in memory for bulk operations
   - Benefit: Faster selection/deselection operations

3. **Real-time Updates vs Simplicity**
   - WebSocket implementation adds complexity
   - Benefit: Essential for good UX with slow operations

## üöÄ Next Steps & Future Improvements

### Immediate Improvements

1. **Testing**
   - Add comprehensive unit tests for search parser
   - Integration tests for bulk operations
   - E2E tests for critical user flows
   - Load testing with 50k+ companies

2. **Performance**
   - Implement virtual scrolling for collections sidebar
   - Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize Elasticsearch queries with query DSL
   - Batch WebSocket updates to reduce overhead

3. **Error Handling**
   - Add retry logic for failed bulk operations
   - Implement partial failure recovery
   - Better error messages with actionable steps

### Feature Enhancements

1. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Save and share filter presets
   - Complex boolean queries (AND/OR/NOT)
   - Date range filters for funding rounds
   - Geographic search with maps integration

2. **Collaboration Features**
   - Share collections with team members
   - Comments on companies

   - Add CDN for static assets
   - Container orchestration with Kubernetes

2. **Monitoring**
   - Add APM (Application Performance Monitoring)
